<main><h2>Story Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Project Hail Mary follows Ryland Grace, a middle-school science teacher who wakes up alone on a spacecraft with no memory of who he is or why he is there. 
    As fragments return, he learns Earth faces a crisis: a mysterious infrared "Petrova line" and a parasitic microbe draining stars of energy. 
    His ship—built at breakneck speed under a globally empowered director—was sent to the one nearby system that isn’t failing, in hopes of finding an answer.
    Armed with a fully stocked lab, automated systems, and a way to transmit discoveries home, Grace must investigate an alien biology that breaks the rules, navigate relativistic spaceflight, and improvise under constant risk. 
    Isolation, dwindling resources, and hard choices define his days—until an unexpected neighbor forces him to consider cooperation on truly interstellar terms.
    With a tone that blends problem‑solving, first contact, and survival, the story explores ingenuity, communication across profound differences, and the sacrifices people make for one another and for their worlds. It is as much about building trust as it is about saving suns. Project Hail Mary marries hard science with a deeply humane core. Beneath the propulsive puzzles and orbital mechanics lies a story about how intelligence—human or otherwise—survives by cooperating, adapting, and choosing connection over fear. 
    The chapters trace Ryland Grace’s journey from amnesiac isolation to interstellar friendship, 
    turning a rescue-of-Earth premise into a meditation on what makes a civilization worth saving.</p>
